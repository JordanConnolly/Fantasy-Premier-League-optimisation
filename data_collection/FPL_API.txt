What is the FPL API?
in layman’s terms, the FPL API is a series of URL endpoints that allow you to retrieve data from the FPL site in json format (key value pairs in curly brackets), which you can use for yourself in any apps you create.

Every endpoint begins with the /api/ parameter, so every fall you make will be:

https://www.fantasy.premierleague.com/api/{some-other-parameter-here}

For any of the examples below, if you just put them into your URL tab, you’ll see the json returned in the browser.

https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/leagues-classic/314/standings/?page_standings=number

Bonus tips
Always end the URL with a trailing forward slash ‘/’, or else it won’t retrieve the data
If you’re making these calls via the front-end browser within an app, you’ll have to use a proxy to avoid CORS errors.
Occasionally during the off-season, FPL make changes to the format of the calls. Always check during the summer whether anything has changed if you publish any tools or apps.
Code Examples
Some examples below showing how to do a basic connection:

Javascript

Getting the bootstrap-static data, and determining the current gameweek:

 fetch("https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/")  
.then(res => res.json())  
.then( (result) => { let currentWeek = 1; let events = result.events; events.forEach(function(element) { if(element.finished === true){ currentWeek = element.id; }
Python

import requests, json
from pprint import pprint
base_url = 'https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/' 
r = requests.get(base_url+'bootstrap-static/').json() 
pprint(r, indent=2, depth=1, compact=True)
PHP/Curl

$fplUrl = 'https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/leagues-classic/' . $league_id . '/standings/';
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $fplUrl);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, false);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
$league_data = json_decode($response, true);
curl_close($ch);
